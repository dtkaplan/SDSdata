\description{
It's hard to get pollsters' raw data; only the tabulated results
seem to be available. This is some \href{https://surveys.google.com/reporting/survey?survey=mqbskxyva7gb4h4uwgc7j6h2na}{actual data},
which relate to a 2017 Montana special election for its Congressional seat.
We found the data by following the link, which was published
\href{https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fake-polls-are-a-real-problem/}{in this story at fivethirtyeight.com}.
