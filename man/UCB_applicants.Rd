graduate school at UC Berkeley for the Fall 1973 quarter.
\itemize{
\item \code{admit}: Whether the applicant was admitted.
\item \code{gender}: male or female
\item \code{dept}: The graduate department applied to. Rather than identifying the actual

\description{
Roster of applicants to six major departments at UC Berkeley
}
\details{
In 1973, officials at the University of California Berkeley noticed
disturbing trends in graduate admissions rates. The data, with department names redacted,
was presented and interpretted in a famous paper in \emph{Science}, Bickel et al. 1975. In
that paper, summary tables were presented. \code{UCB_applicants} was reverse
engineered from \code{datasets::UCBAdmissions} into
a data table where the unit of observation is an individual applicant. The origin of
\code{datasets::UCBAdmissions} is not clear; those data are not explicitly provided in Bickel et al.
