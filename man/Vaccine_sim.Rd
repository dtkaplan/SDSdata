\title{Simulated vaccine/flu/mortality data}
\format{A data frame object with one row for each (simulated) person:
\itemize{
\item \code{health}: whether the person was in poor health
\item \code{vaccination} did the person get vaccinated
\item \code{flu} did the person get the flu
\item \code{mortality}: did the person die
}

The symbol "o" in the data frame indicates negation. For example, the levels
of \code{Flu} are \code{"Yes"} and \code{"o"}, which means yes and no.}
