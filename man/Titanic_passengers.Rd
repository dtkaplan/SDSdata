Passengers and crew on RMS Titanic
}
\details{
The \code{Titanic_passengers} data frame is a roster of 1309 passengers on the steamship Titanic.
At the time of the sinking, there were approximately 2400 people on board the ship. Of these, approximately
1330 were passengers, together with approximately 895 crew. The passenger list includes approximately
42 people who were servants of other passengers. According to many reports, 712 people
survived  the sinking. (See, e.g. \url{https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivors/}.)
The \code{survived} column,  combining \code{Titanic_passengers} and \code{Titanic_crew} lists only 628 survivors. The source
of the  discrepancy is unknown.
